# Is Someone There Or Is That The TV? Detecting Social Presence Using Sound

Make the input vector for ML classifiers using natural_vs_media.py. 
A five second wavefile, recorded at 16kHz on a Kinect One microphone should be used.

The two classes for classifiers are 0 (media) and 1 (natural).

Trained StandardScaler, SVC, LR, DT, QDA, GNB, and KNN are available.
